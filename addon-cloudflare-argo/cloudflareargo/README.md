## About

This is a very hacky setup of Cloudflare argo that helps people access their Home Assistant and other HassOS addons via a public URL.

Cloudflare Argo uses a tunnel and therefore bypasses any need for a NAT'd public IP (LTE connections) or opening firewall ports etc.

## CONFIG

The basic config enables 1 Cloudflare Argo tunnel using:

Hostname (The hostname to pass to Cloudflare)
URL (The local url you want to put online)
Certificate (local path to the Cloudflare Argo Certificate)

The addon supports 3 tunnels using the additional configuration values:
```
- hostname: hostname2
  service: service2
  #if self signed certificate
  originRequest:
    noTLSVerify: true

- hostname: hostname3
  service: service3
  #if self signed certificate
  originRequest:
    noTLSVerify: true
```

If you do not configure hostname/service 2 and 3 it will not run.

You'll need to sign up for Argo with Cloudflare directly and generate an SSL certificate at the following url:
https://www.cloudflare.com/a/warp

## Home Assistant Config

As of the newest updates HA also needs to be told to allow proxies, the following is an example of what should be added to your config to avoid 400: bad request issues

```
http:
  trusted_proxies: 172.30.32.0/23
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
```

## Multiple Domains

By default a .pem file from Cloudflare only allows access from a single domain name, if you want multiple domains you'll need multiple .pem files.

Even if you are using the same .pem file for all tunnels you'll need to specify certificate2 and certificate3.
